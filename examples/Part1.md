This year, I ventured beyond the usual CRUD applications and tackled an exciting challenge involving file management automation. Our team initially considered JavaScript-based solutions, exploring plugins like CKEditor and Quill. However, our specific formatting needs led us to realize these wouldn’t suffice.
<br />
<br />
That’s when we stumbled upon OnlyOffice, an office suite offering an API for online document handling — a game-changer for us. Though not free, its value justifies the cost, especially with its developer edition and SaaS offerings.
<br />
<br />
In this tutorial series, I’ll guide you through integrating OnlyOffice with Laravel. We’ll set up a new Laravel app, install OnlyOffice locally, and explore advanced features like file conversion, event broadcasting, and Vue.js integration. Get ready to enhance your Laravel projects with robust document management capabilities!
